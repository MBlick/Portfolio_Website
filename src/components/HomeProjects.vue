                  During the final two semesters of my bachelor's degree, I transitioned to a part-time study model to gain hands-on industry experience. I joined Autcomp Automation AG in Stansstad as a Junior Automation Engineer, supporting the team on several projects, most notably, the renewal of the ventilation system in the Gotthard Road Tunnel.

                  Network 41 AG, where I completed my apprenticeship and worked for two years, provides engineering services for Swisscom AG in support of their nationwide Fiber to the Street (FTTS) rollout. The goal of this strategy is to reduce the length of copper lines by bringing fiber optic cables closer to homes, right up to street-side shafts. There, the optical signals are converted into electrical signals via so-called mCANs, allowing for faster and more stable internet connections.

                  For my bachelor's thesis, and as part of my industrial work, I had the incredible opportunity to join the AMZ Racing team of the 2025 season's car called Aurona. Each year, the team designs and builds a new high-performance electric race car to compete in Formula Student Electric (FSE) events, with the ambitious goal of creating the best electric race car in the competition.

                  My specific work package was focused on the development of the Low Voltage Battery Management System (LV BMS) as well as the low voltage supply. This subsystem is responsible for safely distributing and managing all low voltage power throughout the car, enabling critical electronics, sensors, and control units to function reliably under demanding racing conditions. The complexity of this task led to the design of five custom PCB's, one of which features a stacked configuration to optimize space and functionality within the vehicle's tight packaging constraints.

                  This mandatory unit provided intermediate-level knowledge of key electronic components and systems, including transistors, operational amplifiers, oscillators, AD and DA converters, filters, noise reduction, and PCB design.

                  As part of the unit, we were tasked with a project to apply what we had learned. In a team of two, we designed and built a fully functional optical smoke detector. The project gave us hands-on experience with circuit design, sensor integration, and PCB layout. The final report (in German) can be accessed at the following link:

                  As part of a block week on PCB design at HSLU, we were given the choice to either replicate a reference PCB provided by our professors or to create a design for a personal project. I chose to take the opportunity to work on a practical and forward-looking idea, designing a custom PCB for the next generation of my desk PC project.

                  This PCB serves as the central control unit for the desk PC, acting as its "brain." It allows the user to:

                  During my studies at HSLU, I completed two units focused on website development. To further deepen my knowledge in this area, I decided to create my own portfolio website. While web development may not be a typical task for an electrical engineer, I saw it as a great opportunity to showcase one of my many skill sets.

                  In the first semester of my electrical engineering studies, I built a basic lab power supply, which was heavily used during the testing phase of my first project unit, where we developed a gravel cleaning robot. Recognizing how useful this tool was, I decided to enhance the original design by addressing some missing features.

                  During the summer of 2020, amidst the corona pandemic, I found myself with some extra time and decided to build a desk PC. The unique aspect of this project is that all the computer hardware is completely hidden inside the desk, making it invisible at first glance.
                </p>
                <p class="">
                  To achieve this, I had to design and build the desk from scratch. One of the main challenges was the cooling system, due to the limited internal height of only 9 cm, traditional tower coolers couldn't be installed. To overcome this, I opted for a water cooling system, ensuring optimal thermal performance. Key information, photos, and other details can be found in the following project overview:
