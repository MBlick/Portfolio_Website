                  While in my last two semesters of my bachelor's, I chose to switch to a part-time study model. Thereby, working at Autcomp Automation AG in Stansstad as a junior automation engineer to support the team in their pursuit. There, I received the chance to work on the renewal of the ventilation system of the Gotthard Road Tunnel. Where my main task was to multiply and extend the written code in Siemens TIA and adapt several concepts from a given project documentation. Furthermore, I was involved in various other projects and also in creating schemes for them. A skill which I could take over from my apprenticeship.

In my two-year period after the apprenticeship at Network 41 AG and in the summer jobs at HT-Infraserv AG, I've worked on several interesting projects. A few of them can be seen in the following list:

                  Network 41 AG, the company where I made my apprenticeship and worked for two years, offers engineering services for Swisscom AG and their fiber to the street (FTTS) rollout in all of Switzerland. The strategy is to shorten the distance of the copper wire by bringing fiber optic cables to the porch of our houses. There, inside a shaft, the light signals get converted, with so-called mCANs, into an electrical copper signal. I was fortunate to receive several further trainings to work within the Swisscom project management environment. Followed by that, I then became a project manager for two small villages where this rollout took place.

                  Similarly to the FTTS rollout, Network 41 AG also provides engineering services to the Swisscom AG regarding their mobile expansion. If a new location for a mobile antenna has been set, there are many technical conditions that need to be met. One of them is the electrical supply. For that reason, I was able to visit several locations in Switzerland where I had to do on-site clarifications and plan out the electrical power supply to fit the needs of these mobile antennas.

                  This mandatory project unit provided thorough knowledge of project management and teamwork.
                  Furthermore, it
                  taught their students on how to tackle a problem and find the most economic and environmentally
                  friendly solution to it. The goal of the project was to create a concept of a gravel cleaning robot.
                  The project was approached in a team of seven members which interdisciplinary consisted of the three
                  departments electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and software engineering. The report (in
                  German) can be read at the following link:
                  This project unit builds up on the previous one where the concept has been established. The goal was
                  to build and realize said concept. Realizing a concept is always harder than expected. Still, our team
                  managed to overcome all the hurdles and even won the final contest, where all 26 teams competed
                  against each other. Furthermore, it has to be noted that our team has achieved the best grade, as the
                  only team, in both project units. As before, the report (in German) can be read at the following link:

                  further deepen this knowledge, I decided to create my own portfolio website. Though, this is not a
                  typical task for an electrical engineer, I thought it was a great idea to further show one of my many
                  skill sets. In the future, this website might even be completely overhauled and serve an entirely
                  different purpose.

                  In the first semester of my studies in electrical engineering, I built a basic lab power supply. It
                  has been used intensively in the testing phase of the first project unit. Realizing how handy such a
                  power supply is, I wanted the first version to be overhauled because of it lacking some features. The
                  second version was designed using Fusion 360 and 3D-printed with my own 3D-printer at home. Key
                  information, photos and circuitry can be found in the following project overview:

                  Whilst in the middle of the corona pandemic (summer 2020), I got bored and built a desk PC. The clue is,
                  that all computer hardware is completely hidden inside the desk and not visible at first glance. For
                  that reason, I had to build the desk from scratch. Furthermore, the issue of cooling had to be
                  addressed. Because of the minimal height of 9 cm inside the desk, no tower cooler could be installed.
                  Consequently, a water cooling system has been put in place. Key information, photos and circuitry can
                  be found in the following project overview:

                  By repurposing an old PC-Fan, I've created a simple new product that keeps me cool in hot summers. It
                  has a 5 V micro USB plug that can be powered by any phone charger. Due to the large fan size of 200
                  mm, there is hardly any noise while still delivering a fair amount of airflow. To easily place the fan
                  everywhere, a tripod of an old selfie stick has been repurposed to be the stand of this fan.
                  Therefore, the fan can be placed on all flat surfaces. Additionally, the height can be adjusted. This
                  fan is fairly simple and easy to build, but still, some thought had to be put into it to build this
                  fan. Key information, photos and circuitry can be found in the following project overview:
